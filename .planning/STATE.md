## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Data model: Replace filamentId/filamentGrams with filaments[] array (clean migration, no dual code paths)
- UX: Single row default, "+" to add more (preserves current experience for majority single-filament case)
- Import matching: Auto-match per filament independently; form is the review step (no intermediate dialog)
- Missing per-filament weight: Total on first extruder, zeros for rest (preserves total, signals manual input needed)
- Nozzle wear: Export getMaterialDensity from gcodeParser.ts to fix pre-existing PLA-only density bug
